Books have long been a silent refuge for the restless mind. Whether it's the boundless imagination of science fiction, the gripping tension of thrillers, the eerie chill of horror, or the emotional pull of fictional drama, books offer an escape that few human conversations can match. When anger brews or emotions become too heavy, flipping through pages becomes a form of therapy—stories unfolding without judgment. People often prefer books over humans not because they are lonely, but because books listen silently, speak wisely, and never interrupt. They help us understand complex emotions, offer new perspectives, and remind us that we’re not alone in our thoughts. In a world that’s always rushing, books invite us to slow down and feel.
